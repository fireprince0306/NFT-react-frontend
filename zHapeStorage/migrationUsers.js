Boot strapped and co-founded the business in 2008 and have achieved inc500 as a top 111 company overall and #17 in marketing and advertising category. We are a direct to consumer network of media buyers and high volume publishers and influencers. My first computer was an Apple iie, my love for computer began with Visual Basic and grew over the years. In 2001 I completed my professional training at Full Sail University, I was quite early to digital media design and technology. By 21, I launched my first ad agency in Orlando, Florida immediately following my graduation, entrepreneurship has always been in my blood. By 2005 I discovered affiliate marketing and shifted my focus to these markets. Today I have a global network of over 40,000 affiliates and partners worldwide. By 2012 I started making my first investments in OTC, stocks and investments as an accredited investor. I paid dearly during my early years as many investing mistakes were made. By 2014 I purchased my first Bitcoin and had no idea what I was really doing but immediately fell in love with the concept of digital currency and blockchain applications. I immediately jumped into mining in 2015 with two S4 Miners and upgraded to a small farm of S9's later in 2016. NFT's are my true love as it brings together my background in art, design and creativity as the art now lives on the blockchain. What a time to be alive. I spend the majority of my time today investing in projects (early stage, real estate, crowd funding, fractionalized real estate, short term rentals, stocks, options, deFi, and of course blue chips both in crypto and NFTs. I look forward to helping each and everyone in the HAPE community grow and learn so they can continue to grow and help others though information and personal development. I would love to one day have the opportunity to share with others though speaking engagements. ",

Boot strapped and co-founded the business in 2008 and have achieved inc500 as a top 111 company overall and #17 in marketing and advertising category. We are a direct to consumer network of media buyers and high volume publishers and influencers. My first computer was an Apple iie, my love for computer began with Visual Basic and grew over the years. In 2001 I completed my professional training at Full Sail University, I was quite early to digital media design and technology. By 21, I launched my first ad agency in Orlando, Florida immediately following my graduation, entrepreneurship has always been in my blood. By 2005 I discovered affiliate marketing and shifted my focus to these markets. Today I have a global network of over 40,000 affiliates and partners worldwide. By 2012 I started making my first investments in OTC, stocks and investments as an accredited investor. I paid dearly during my early years as many investing mistakes were made. By 2014 I purchased my first Bitcoin and had no idea what I was really doing but immediately fell in love with the concept of digital currency and blockchain applications. I immediately jumped into mining in 2015 with two S4 Miners and upgraded to a small farm of S9's later in 2016. NFT's are my true love as it brings together my background in art, design and creativity as the art now lives on the blockchain. What a time to be alive. I spend the majority of my time today investing in projects (early stage, real estate, crowd funding, fractionalized real estate, short term rentals, stocks, options, deFi, and of course blue chips both in crypto and NFTs. I look forward to helping each and everyone in the HAPE community grow and learn so they can continue to grow and help others though information and personal development. I would love to one day have the opportunity to share with others though speaking engagements. ",

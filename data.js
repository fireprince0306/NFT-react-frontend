				"I'm currently working as a Senior Account Executive at an international company. I've worked in sales for approx.15 years and over this time I have been focused on improving my general knowledge of how sales works. Second to my sales experience, I currently help companies strengthen their Employer Branding so that has opened the option for me to learn about Marketing. \n\nI also have a great passion for personal development and have made great steps of my own in regards of my mentality, drive and motivation in life. \n\nLong story short: if you want to learn anything about sales, or personal development, feel free to contact me so we can hopefully have a mutually beneficial conversation.",
